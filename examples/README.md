# Python GitHub Backup Tool

This is a moderate-complexity Python CLI tool that demonstrates the Insight analysis capabilities.

## Project Overview
- **Main file**: github_backup/github_backup.py (1478 lines)  
- **Total lines**: ~1500 lines of Python code
- **Features**: GitHub API interactions, CLI argument parsing, backup functionality
- **Dependencies**: Uses standard library + external packages like certifi
- **Structure**: Well-organized package with proper setup.py

## Why This Example?
This project provides a realistic example of:
- Real-world CLI tool with complex logic
- Multiple Python modules and classes  
- External API interactions (GitHub API)
- Command-line argument parsing with argparse
- File system operations and data backup logic
- Error handling and logging
- Package structure with setup.py

## Analysis Results
When analyzed with Insight, this project demonstrates:
- AST parsing of complex Python code
- Detection of class inheritance (S3HTTPRedirectHandler)
- Identification of 35+ functions across multiple files
- Complexity analysis highlighting the main logic file
- Generation of multiple Mermaid diagrams
- Dependency analysis showing internal and external imports

Perfect for testing and demonstrating the power of automated code analysis!
